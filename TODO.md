# TODOs:

-   [x] Fix Export
    -   [x] Exported Java-Runtime was missing `d3d, ws`, seemingly because not all necessary DLLs were copied from the JavaFX Sdk to the runtime
-   [ ] Package Export to a single Launcher
    -   [ ] Find some way to package the distributable into a single launcher executable
    -   [ ] Best way is probably by letting the launcher create a temporary directory with all the files and calling them then (wouldn't fuck up paths)
-   [x] Fix Umlaut-changes
    -   [x] Only the last vowel/diphtong in a word should have its umlaut changed
-   [x] Check Term-Sorting
    -   [x] Make sure the terms are sorted correctly after calling `query`
-   [x] createTerm fails for certain inputs
    -   [x] in first test, it especially failed for male-accusative-plural
    -   [x] go through with Debugger, to fix it
-   [ ] Offer randomized querying
    -   [ ] Build random query
    -   [ ] Use the randomized query in the songGenerator.
-   [x] Check if Hyphenizer works correctly
    -   [x] Currently it seems to mark all nouns as having 2 syllables
-   [ ] Add Templates
-   [ ] Add proper Error Handling
-   [x] Update Nouns-Dictionary
