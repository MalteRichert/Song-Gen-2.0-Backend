# Dictionary Creation

The Resource Files for the Dictionary class of the SongGenerator are created here. \
The `nouns.csv` and `verbs.csv` files are lists of german nouns and verbs. \
These files were created via XML-Dumps from Wikipedia. \
The `generateDict.py` script preprocesses these lists into more useful resource files, which are then used by the program.

The python script doesn't need to be run anymore, since the resource files are already created. \
