# These templates each hold a map of parts, a property indicating the basePart and a list specifying the order of parts.
# Each part consists of a length (has to be a multiple of the length of at least one chord progression in the same genre),
#   a list of required instruments and a list of optional instruments.
# Instruments have to be configured in InstrumentEnum.java and instrument_mapping.yml with a unique midi instrument value.
# Every property has to be specified; the value of opt can be an empty list though.
