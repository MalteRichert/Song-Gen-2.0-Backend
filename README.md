# SongGenerator

### Get started

This is the source code for the "SongGenerator" project from the lecture SoftwareEngineering I. \
To run the SongGenerator, download the repository and run the `build.bat` file. \
This will create a new `dist` folder, in which you find an `SongGenerator.bat` file. Running that file will execute the program.

### Dive in the code

For a highlevel overview > consult the architecture document (not included in this repository). \
For an overview at package level > consult the readme inside each of the packages (music, text-analysis, text-generation, etc.) \
For detailed insights on a code-level > classes and complicated methods are equipped with explanatory docstrings. \
