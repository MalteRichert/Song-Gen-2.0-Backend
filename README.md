# SongGenerator

### Get started

This is the source code for the "SongGenerator" project from the lecture SoftwareEngineering I. \
To build the SongGenerator yourself, you need to use Windows and have [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and [JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) 19 or higher downloaded. \
Then open the `build.bat` file and update the `java-path` and `javafx-path` variables if necessary. \
They should point to your Java and JavaFX SDK-Paths respectively. \
You can now run the `build.bat` file. \
This will create a new `dist` folder, in which you can find the `SongGenerator.bat` file. Running that file will execute the program.

### Dive into the code

For a highlevel overview > consult the architecture document (not included in this repository). \
For an overview at package level > consult the readme inside each of the packages (music, text-analysis, text-generation, etc.) \
For detailed insights on a code-level > classes and complicated methods are equipped with explanatory docstrings. \
