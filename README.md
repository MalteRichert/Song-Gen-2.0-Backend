# Song Gen 2

This fork of the [Song Generator Project](https://github.com/Rex2002/songGenerator) ditches the javaFX-based UI and provides a REST API to enable a simpler song generator experience on the web. <br>
[Rex2002](https://github.com/Rex2002) built a React web app that consumes this API and can be used [here](https://rex2002.github.io/song-gen-2.0-frontend/#/).<br>
<br>
Text generation is disabled for the time being because it requires significant resources that we can't provide with free-to-use hosting.<br>
