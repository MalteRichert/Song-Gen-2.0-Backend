How to run the SongGenerator:

To open the App, double click on the "SongGenerator.bat" file in this folder. This will open a terminal window and the application itself. Don't close the terminal window, it will close automatically when the application closes.

You can now load a Text or PDF-File into the SongGenerator. To do so, simply click the "Load"-Button and choose your file. Alternatively you can also drag-and-drop your file into the designated field in the Application. You see that the file was loaded successfully, when you see the correct path to the file next to the "Load"-Button.

You can also change the default settings via the "Settings"-Button.

To start generating your Song, you have to press the "Generate"-Button. As soon as it says "Done" above the Progress-Bar, the song is successfully generated and you can download it via the "Save"-Button.

The downloaded file contains the generated song in the Midi-format. 
The SongGenerator is optimized to generate midi-files that can be directly imported into and played by MusceScore 3. Using a different software may lead to optical issues with the text placement or slightly different instrument sounds( if the program uses a Soundbank that is different to the one used by MuseScore).
